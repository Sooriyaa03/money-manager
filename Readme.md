# Money Manager – Personal & Office Finance Tracker

## Project Description

Money Manager is a full-stack web application built to help users manage their personal and office finances in a simple and organized way. The application allows users to record income and expenses, analyze spending patterns, plan monthly budgets, and track transfers between accounts — all from a single, easy-to-use dashboard.

The primary objective of this project is to make financial tracking practical for everyday use by combining clear visual insights with structured data management. It is designed to support both personal and professional expense tracking without adding unnecessary complexity.

## Problem Statement

Many people rely on spreadsheets, notes, or basic apps to track finances. While these methods work at a basic level, they make it difficult to:

* Understand where money is actually being spent
* Separate personal expenses from office or work-related expenses
* Analyze income and expenses over time
* Set and monitor spending limits
* Track money movement between different accounts

Money Manager addresses these challenges by providing a structured and visual approach to financial management.

## Key Features

### 1. Income and Expense Management

Users can record both income and expense transactions. Each transaction captures:

* Amount
* Date and time
* Category (such as food, fuel, medical, etc.)
* Division (Personal or Office)
* Account (cash, bank, wallet)
* Optional description

All transactions are stored securely and reflected immediately across the application.

---

### 2. Analytics Dashboard

The dashboard provides a clear comparison of income versus expenses using visual charts. Users can view analytics on a:

* Weekly
* Monthly
* Yearly basis

These visual summaries help users quickly understand financial trends and overall balance.

---

### 3. Category-Wise Expense Summary

Expenses are grouped by category and displayed using a donut chart along with a readable list. This helps users identify major spending areas and understand how their money is distributed across categories.

---

### 4. Advanced Filtering and Date Range Tracking

Users can filter transactions based on:

* Category
* Division (Personal or Office)
* Custom date range

This makes it easy to review financial activity for specific periods or purposes.

---

### 5. Budget Planning and Alerts

The application allows users to set monthly budgets for individual categories. For each category, the system shows:

* Amount spent
* Budget limit
* Percentage of budget used

Visual indicators clearly highlight when spending exceeds the set limit.

---

### 6. Account-Based Transactions and Transfers

Transactions are linked to specific accounts such as cash, bank, or wallet. The application also supports account-to-account transfers (for example, transferring money from a bank account to a wallet). These transfers are tracked separately and do not affect income or expense calculations.

---

### 7. Real-World Usage Constraints

To reflect realistic financial behavior, transactions can only be edited within 12 hours of creation. This prevents accidental or unrealistic changes and mirrors real-world financial system constraints.

## Outcome

By combining structured data entry, visual analytics, and real-world constraints, the application offers a practical tool suitable for personal use as well as small business expense management.
